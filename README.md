# BLsecuritypanel
This is a customisation of the Homeseer Alarm panel for the BLADE plug in "BLSecurity"

# Installing the solution
Simply copy the files into the folder:

C:\Program Files (x86)\{Your homeseer installation folder}\html


# Setting up within the Plugin
Open the Plug in and select "Options"
Scroll down to "Custom Alarm Panel"
Enter the relative path and name of the htm file that is your new alarm panel

As an example, if the javascript files would have been previously installed to:

C:\Program Files (x86)\{Your homeseer installation folder}\html

Then this folder is the "root" of the built in HTTP server and your new custom panel will be specified as:

\blsecurity\NewAlarmPanel.html

# You own customisations
You can modify the images as you wish
